    <img src="New-England-Clam-Chowder.jpg" alt="Bowl of Delicious Clam Chowder" height="400" width="300">
    <p> This is the best New England Clam Chowder you will ever eat! Some say that Manhattan Clam
        chowder is better,  but I tend to disagree. There is nothing like the creamy consistenct of
        a good bowl of New England Clam Chowder.

      </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><strong><u>Steps</u></strong></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Drain clam juice from cans into a liquid measuring cup. Add enough bottled clam juice to equal 2 ½ cups. Set aside. (See directions in Notes if using fresh clams.)</li>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook bacon over medium heat until fat is rendered and slightly brown. Remove half of the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons grease. To the remaining bacon and drippings, melt in 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium high and add celery and onion. Sauté for 5-7 minutes or until onions are soft. Add potatoes, garlic, red pepper (if using) and sauté 30 seconds. Sprinkle in flour and cook an additional 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth, reserved 2 ½ cups clam juice, chicken bouillon, bay leaves and all seasonings. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until potatoes are very tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in heavy cream and bring to a simmer to heat through. Discard bay leaves. Remove from heat and stir in clams. Taste and add salt/pepper to taste. (You may or may not need additional salt depending on how salty your clams and bacon are.) For a thinner or less chunky soup stir in additional heavy cream/milk or chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Top individual servings with reserved bacon and oyster crackers and fresh parsley if desired.</li>
      </ol>
